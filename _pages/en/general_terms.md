The landlord is bound by a commitment to provide the facilities and services specified in accordance with the contract.

## Special Conditions and Information

In addition to the accommodation costs the customer is required to pay the costs of the final cleaning of the accommodation. The final (cleaning) inspection will be carried out by the local agent. The final cleaning price is paid in advance after the agent finished the final inspection and agrees to the condition of the accommodation we refund the money for the final cleaning.

Permission is granted for one pet only. If pets are not permitted this does not mean that there will definitely be no pets in the holiday accommodation vicinity.

The landlord or person handing over the key to the rented accommodation is entitled to demand a suitable deposit. The deposit is reimbursed on departure provided the rented accommodation is in an orderly condition.

The customer commits himself to replacing or paying for any damage occurring during his occupation.

Arrival may be timed between 12 noon and 7 p.m. on the day of arrival. The accommodation must be vacated by 11 a.m. at the latest on the day of departure.

## Cancelling Accommodation

You may cancel booked accommodation at any time prior to begin of the holiday. Decisive factor for the calculation of costs on cancellation of a contract is the date of receipt of cancellation by the landlord. The following ruling covers the calculation of cancellation costs: on a cancellation of up to 61 days prior to start of holiday 10% of the total costs must be paid, on cancellation from 60th to 45th day prior to start of holiday 25% of total costs are due, from 44th to 35th day 50% of total costs are due, from 34th to 10th day prior to start of holiday 80% of total costs becomes due. However at least 50,- Euro per unit is due. If a cancellation is made at a later time or when the customer does not arrive to take up his accommodation or when the booked facilities and services are only partially utilized (e.g. departure is earlier than planned), the total costs of the accommodation must be paid. If the landlord is successful in finding a substitute customer for the same period and for the same conditions, only 10% of the total costs become due, regardless of the date of cancellation.

## Changes

Booking changes made after the accommodation has been reserved, additional services (e.g. pet accompanying customer) or changes in the dates, the destination or the type of accommodation can be carried out by the landlord up to 35 days prior to start of holiday for a fee of € 50,- per change. Changes at a later date can only be carried out by cancelling the booking contract (under the conditions specified in "Cancelling Accommodation") and making a new booking. A deviation from the rulings specified under "Cancelling Accommodation" come into force when the customer is able to provide a replacement customer before start of the holiday. With the confirmation by the landlord of the change in name the new customer accepts the legal rights and obligations under the accommodation contract. The fees for this alteration will be charged to the original customer at € 50,- per unit by the landlord.

## Cancellation by Landlord

The landlord is entitled to withdraw from the accommodation contract before start of holiday or to cancel the accommodation contract without notice after begin of the holiday if the customer endangers others regardless of warnings or if he infringes against the conditions of the contract. The total costs of the accommodation are then forfeited. Cancellation by the landlord is also possible when the holiday cannot be carried through without considerable difficulties, danger or impairment due to unforeseen causes, e.g. an act of God, unrest, etc. All paid monies are reimbursed before start of holiday. However, all other claims are specifically excluded. After start of holiday the landlord will reimburse the customer with a part of the costs in proportion to the facilities and services not utilized.

## Liability

The landlord accepts liability within the applicable range of the law. The landlord is liable within the framework of a regular businessman's duty of care for the correctness of the description of facilities and services and the correct delivery of services as determined in the contract between customer and landlord. Liability for occasional failures of water or power supplies are excluded, and liability for the continuous operation of systems such as heating, air-conditioning, etc. is also excluded. The landlord accepts no liability whatsoever for loss of luggage of the customer, even if it is of considerable value. In their own interests customers are recommended to take out an insurance covering accidents and loss of luggage during the holiday.

## Cooperation, Complaints, Exclusion of Claims, Statute of Limitation

The customer is obliged within the framework of legal requirements to do everything within reason to cooperate in remedying possible disruptions or faults and to assist in avoiding or keeping damage as small as possible. This particularly covers the responsibility of reporting complaints immediately. In areas without a travel agent complaints should be made to the landlord or person responsible for handing over the keys of the accommodation. The landlord or responsible person is responsible for correcting the problem, if possible. If the customer does not report his complaint he forfeits his rights to a reduction in the costs of the holiday. If you discover faults or defects in your accommodation, you are within your rights to demand corrections or repairs. You must contact the landlord immediately so that the defects can be checked and a suitable remedy or repairs can be undertaken or a substitute supplied. Claims against the landlord for facilities and services not provided as specified in the booking contract must be made within four weeks after the contractually specified end of the booked accommodation. All information is provided according to best of our knowledge, but without guarantee. All rights to the correction of errors as well as printing and calculation errors are reserved. The disabling of individual regulations in the booking contract does not result in the ineffectiveness of the entire booking contract.

## Passport, Visa and Health Regulations

The customer is personally responsible for the observance of all important regulations governing the travel arrangements. All inconveniences arising from the customer not adhering to these regulations are the responsibility of the customer alone, except where they are the result of culpable misinformation by the landlord. Customers with German nationality generally require only a valid identity document or valid passport for entry into Croatia. Children also require their own valid travel documents. Other customers, especially those from countries not within the European Union, are personally responsible for the timely application for the issue of necessary travel documents through diplomatic representatives.
